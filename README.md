objective:  The calculated BMI is then compared against predefined ranges to determine a health category. Common categories and their associated BMI ranges include:
Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal Weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater
The program prints the calculated BMI value and the corresponding health category to the console.

TOOL USED
The general process for creating such a tool involves:
Importing necessary modules: import random and import string.
Defining character sets: Combine desired character types (e.g., string.ascii_letters, string.digits, string.punctuation) into a single string or list of characters.
Getting user input (optional): Prompt the user for desired password length and criteria (e.g., include numbers, symbols).
Generating the password:
Use random.choice() or random.choices() to select characters randomly from the defined character set.
Repeat this selection process for the specified password length.
Constructing the final password: Join the selected characters into a single string using "".join().

STEP PERFORMED
Creating a random password generator in Python typically involves the following steps:
Import necessary modules:
random: For generating random choices or samples.
string: To access predefined sets of characters like lowercase letters (string.ascii_lowercase), uppercase letters (string.ascii_uppercase), digits (string.digits), and punctuation (string.punctuation).
Define the character set:
Combine the desired character types (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols) into a single string or list of characters from which the password will be generated. This forms the pool of available characters.
Get user input (optional but common):
Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
Optionally, ask the user to select which character types (e.g., include numbers, include symbols) they want to incorporate into the password for customization.

OUTCOME
If a Python script designed to generate a 12-character password using a mix of all character types is executed, a possible outcome could be:
Code
Your generated password is: }2:Lz,1!Gv!
